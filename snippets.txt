Class: Word Generator
    Takes in options
    What level: CVC, Final E, etc
    Implement 
    Returns word at the end

service class encapsulates logic for an action
generate calls sub-functions. other python files only interact with generate method
rules engine goes in here
private methods? 




# def get_letter_subset(letter_type, **kwargs): 
#     """Get letter with given characteristics."""
# 
#   if letter_type == 'vowel':
#   for key, value in kwargs.items():
#     getattr(vowel, key, value)
#
#       return Vowel.query.filter(Vowel.chars.like(chars)).first()

get_letter_subset(
    letter_type is vowel or consonant
    kwargs would include a key (rule to sort) and a value or values (could be int, str, bool)
    alt: pass an object that has fields for this
        key: 'level', value: 2



Build a separate Class for this - a rules engine. 
DON'T DO: Every rule is its own class and you can dynamically follow?
